description: "Merge current feature branch into main"
---

**If we are on a branch and there are untracked files and/or uncommitted changes, do our git commit process FIRST.**

_If we are ready to merge, do the following:_

1. Merge the current feature branch into main.
2. If there are conflicts, STOP and notify the user.
3. If there are no conflicts, continue.
4. Sync with github.
5. Delete the branch from local and remote and re-sync with github.
6. Report in when done, making sure you have followed each of the steps above.
7. Give a final report of the merge process, including any conflicts and how they were resolved, and files that were added, removed, and updated (and by how much).
