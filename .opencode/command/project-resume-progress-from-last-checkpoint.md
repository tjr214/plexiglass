Activate the BMAD Master Agent. **CRITICAL**: Do NOT be confused by the "@" symbol. The BMAD Master agent persona file is located at `_bmad/core/agents/bmad-master.md` in the project root. You need to load this EXACT location: `_bmad/core/agents/bmad-master.md`. Do NOT insert the "at" symbol when trying to load this file!

Let's review the status of the project.

Read and study `docs/LIVING_DOCS.md`.

Read and study `PROGRESS.md` in the project root. In addition, read and study all of the documents listed in the "Review Documentation" section.

Where did we last leave off?

Then, give me options for continuing the work.

**CRITICAL**: NEVER OVERWRITE a `SESSION_X_SUMMARY.md` session summary file. _Always create a new session summary markdown file in the `docs/` directory!_
