## 1. CRITICAL LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS

**CRITICAL**:

- _DO NOT use lazy placeholders._ Output the FULL code block required for the search/replace.

- When implementing, _ALWAYS use a TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR loop._ Ensure this is properly reflected in all Plans made and executed.

- ALWAYS be updating the Living Documentation as we complete implementation sections. Ensure this is included in all Plans made and executed.

- All of our unit and integration tests are to be stored in the `tests/` directory in the project root.

- **DOUBLE CRITICAL**: You have to READ files before the system will allow you to edit, update or write to them.

- **IMPORTANT**: Python projects use Python 3.13+, and `uv` and `pyproject.toml` for project management. When adding libraries to the project, look up their latest version and use that version number for the pin with the `>=` operator.
